#TI3.py

So, i needed a way by which i could get all the matches played in [The international 2013](http://dota2.com/international) which is a DOTA2 tournament hosted by valve. Ergo wrote this script. It is a little clunky as of now but shall be improved later on. 

Go [Alliance](http://www.dota2.com/international/players/alliance/)!
